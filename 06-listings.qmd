# Listings

## Let's add a blog

`blog/` has some folders with pages in them.

(*One might be an `.ipynb` so we can highlight that it just works*)

**Demo:**

1. Make a new page `blog/index.qmd` which is a listing `contents: /`, `type: default`, `categories: false` 

## Listings

A listing is:

- an automatically generated list of content, 
- styled via a template, built-in templates specified with `type`,
- can be included on any page

## Your Turn

1.  (Repeat what I did) Make a new page `blog.qmd` which is a listing
2.  Experiment with `type: grid`, `type: table`
3.  Experiment with `categories: true`, `categories: unnumbered`, `categories: cloud`

Discuss with your neighbor: 

-  What makes this a blog? 
-  What would you change if this was a gallery of projects? 

## Review

Some screenshots of experiments

## Adding new items 

**Demo:** Make a new page, fill in appropriate metadata

## A blog is a listing, but a listing doesn't have to be a blog

Include some examples of sites where people use listings for other things

## Listing Fields

https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html#listing-fields

E.g. to exclude date

```
listing:
  type: grid
  contents: posts
  fields: ["image", "title", "categories", "description"]
```

Or, just use year:

```
listing:
  type: grid
  contents: posts
  date-format: YYYY
  fields: ["image", "title", "categories", "description", "date"]
```

## `contents` can be a YAML file

`projects/index.qmd`  where `contents: projects.yml`
`projects/projects.yml` 

`path` can be a relative path to a file in your site, or a URL

(inlcude examples of ^ in template repo, include some local and remote images)

## Your Turn

Add an item to the `projects.yml` listing 

Choose a listing `type` and exclude or add to `fields` as you see fit.

Brainstorm a listing page. What could you use a listing for on your own site?

## Advanced Customization

* More than one listing on a page
* Listing in a custom location on a page
* Custom Listings

Demonstrate via a series of examples from the "wild"

## Custom Listings

Replace Quarto's `default`, `grid` or `table` template with something completely
custom

```
---
title: Talks
listing:
  contents: talks.yml
  template: my-template.ejs
---
```

```{filename="my-template.ejs"}
# some example to show html, iteration and custom keys
```

## Your Turn

Add a listing page to your site:
  - Create a page to house the listing
  - Populate a .yml file with a couple of items (use ... as a template), or create some placeholder `.qmd` files
  - Add the page to your site navigation
